- **Display All Tasks**: Displays all tasks in a table format.
- **Display a Specific Task**: Display a single task by its ID.
- **Exit**: Exits the program.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Rust** installed on your system. You can install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git](https://github.com/t9fiction/Rust-cli-ToDo.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd todo-list
   ```

3. Build and run the application using Cargo (Rust's package manager):
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

### Interaction

Upon running the program, the user will be prompted with a menu of options:

1. **Press 1** to add a new task.
